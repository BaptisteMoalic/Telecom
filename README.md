Some highlight projects I've done during my time at Télécom Paris, the code is present, as well as either pdf reports, slides or documented Jupyter notebooks to explain what has been done:

- TELECOM205: 6-months long project in pairs. We modeled an end-to-end telecommunication system, comprised of every element that a modern Cloud-RAN network would have. We studied the optical link between the remote server and the basestation, the radio-frequency link between the basestation and the users, and finally all the mathematical and networking aspects that could limit the bandwidth and the exchange rate/performance of the whole network.

- TELECOM202b: computer labs about spectral estimation and high resolution methods for spectral estimation (Welch, Bartlett periodograms, ARMA processes, Capon estimator, Fourier transform, signal subspace)

- TELECOM206: computer labs about audio processing (Time-frequency modifications, Dynamic Time Warping, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, Source separation, )

The following projects are present, but only the code, the folders are not organised nor documented:
- PACT: year-long project in groups of 8. With my group, we developped OnionWizz, which is a combo Android app+bracelets which guides user through vibrations. The Android app was coded in Java, and we used SQL/PHP to retrieve and store information about the map/landmarks. I was part of the division "Database" (creating the database) and "Bracelets & social study" (we printed the bracelets with a 3D printer, and led a social survey to design it in the best way possible)

- PAF: 2-week long intensive project. We modeled a power amplifier (used for telecommunications) with a neural network. We then used the neural network as a black box, which replicates the behaviour of the PA. We tested different parameters to identify the equation modeling the PA (linear, quadratic..?)
