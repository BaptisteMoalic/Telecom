% completeTxRx - Script that performs the simulation of the complete communication chain
%
%   The purpose of this script is to demonstrate a complete wireless
%   communication chain.
%   As provided, the chain is not optimized ; ONE OF THE TARGET OF THE
%   PROJECT IS TO OPTIMIZE THE PARAMETERS OF THE SYSTEM SUBBLOCKS IN ORDER
%   TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS.
%   Please pay attention to the fact that FIR filters in this script cause 
%   transient phenomena that have not been compensated. 
%   IT IS YOUR DUTY TO FIND THE EXPRESSION OF THE TOTAL DELAY IN "THE
%   ANALOG TO DIGITAL CONVERSION" SECTION TO MATCH THE TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE
%   DATA. (no hardcoding please...)
%   
%   Hopefully, the script has been written to be self-explanatory. 
%
%   In this project, we use the Quadriga Channel Model ("QuaDRiGa") for
%   generating realistic radio channel impulse responses.
%   It is an open source project whose license can be found in the
%   directories of the project. In order to reduce the footprint in terms
%   of disk space, we do not distribute the documentation (PDF) of the
%   QuaDRiGa toolbox included in the original archive distributed on the
%   official site. Please consult the download page and download the
%   archive to retrieve the documentation.
